 *	BTPageOpaqueData -- At the end of every page, we store a pointer
 *	to both siblings in the tree.  This is used to do forward/backward
 *	index scans.  The next-page link is also critical for recovery when
 *	a search has navigated to the wrong page due to concurrent page splits
 *	or deletions; see src/backend/access/nbtree/README for more info.
 *
 *	In addition, we store the page's btree level (counting upwards from
 *	zero at a leaf page) as well as some flag bits indicating the page type
 *	and status.  If the page is deleted, we replace the level with the
 *	next-transaction-ID value indicating when it is safe to reclaim the page.
 *
 *	We also store a "vacuum cycle ID".  When a page is split while VACUUM is
 *	processing the index, a nonzero value associated with the VACUUM run is
 *	stored into both halves of the split page.  (If VACUUM is not running,
 *	both pages receive zero cycleids.)	This allows VACUUM to detect whether
 *	a page was split since it started, with a small probability of false match
 *	if the page was last split some exact multiple of MAX_BT_CYCLE_ID VACUUMs
 *	ago.  Also, during a split, the BTP_SPLIT_END flag is cleared in the left
 *	(original) page, and set in the right page, but only if the next page
 *	to its right has a different cycleid.
 *
 *	NOTE: the BTP_LEAF flag bit is redundant since level==0 could be tested
 *	instead.

 * INCLUDE B-Tree indexes have non-key attributes.  These are extra

 * the order of items in the index (formally, non-key attributes are not

 * present in leaf index tuples whose item pointers actually point to heap
 * tuples.  All other types of index tuples (collectively, "pivot" tuples)
 * only have key attributes, since pivot tuples only ever need to represent
 * how the key space is separated.  In general, any B-Tree index that has
 * more than one level (i.e. any index that does not just consist of a
 * metapage and a single leaf root page) must have some number of pivot
 * tuples, since pivot tuples are used for traversing the tree.
 *
 * We store the number of attributes present inside pivot tuples by abusing
 * their item pointer offset field, since pivot tuples never need to store a
 * real offset (downlinks only need to store a block number).  The offset
 * field only stores the number of attributes when the INDEX_ALT_TID_MASK
 * bit is set (we never assume that pivot tuples must explicitly store the
 * number of attributes, and currently do not bother storing the number of
 * attributes unless indnkeyatts actually differs from indnatts).
 * INDEX_ALT_TID_MASK is only used for pivot tuples at present, though it's
 * possible that it will be used within non-pivot tuples in the future.  Do
 * not assume that a tuple with INDEX_ALT_TID_MASK set must be a pivot
 * tuple.
 *
 * The 12 least significant offset bits are used to represent the number of
 * attributes in INDEX_ALT_TID_MASK tuples, leaving 4 bits that are reserved
 * for future use (BT_RESERVED_OFFSET_MASK bits). BT_N_KEYS_OFFSET_MASK should

 * (this is needed for VACUUM synchronization, see nbtree/README).  When we
 * are ready to step to the next page, if the caller has told us any of the
 * items were killed, we re-lock the page to mark them killed, then unlock.
