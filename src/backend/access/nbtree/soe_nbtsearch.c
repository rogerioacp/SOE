 *
 * When nextkey is false (the usual case), we are looking for the first

 * Return value is a stack of parent-page pointers.  *bufP is set to the
 * address of the leaf-page buffer, which is read-locked and pinned.
 * No locks are held on the parent pages, however!
 *
 * If the snapshot parameter is not NULL, "old snapshot" checking will take
 * place during the descent through the tree.  This is not needed when
 * positioning for an insert or delete, so NULL is used for those cases.
 *
 * NOTE that the returned buffer is read-locked regardless of the access
 * parameter.  However, access = BT_WRITE will allow an empty root page
 * to be created and returned.  When access = BT_READ, an empty index
 * will result in *bufP being set to InvalidBuffer.  Also, in BT_WRITE mode,
 * any incomplete splits encountered during the search will be finished.
